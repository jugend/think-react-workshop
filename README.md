# Thinking in React Workshop

## Prepare your environment

* Open your browser, visit http://jsbin.com/
* Turn on HTML, CSS, and Output tabs
* Copy the content of 01_html_template.html to the HTML tab
* Copy the content 02_css_template.css to the CSS tab

## Create components

* Turn on Javascript tab, change the filetype to JSX/React, and turn off HTML/CSS tabs
* Copy the content of each of the Javascript file following the index, replacing the previous content for each file
* Read the inline comments with NEW: prefix for changes made in each file
* The last step should reflect a fully working filterable product table
